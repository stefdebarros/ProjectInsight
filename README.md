# Project Insight

Welcome dear visitor!
If you reached this page, I assume that you're interested about my profile, so first of all: thanks for your interest.

In this directory, you can find some examples of different things I have done regarding a variety of data, for now, epidemiological and astrophysics data (with more to come).

## Brazil COVID19 hospitalized patients
The first project shown is about public COVID19 clinical data from Brazil. For this project, public data about hospitalized patients with positive COVID19 test is gathered and the outcome (death/cure) is studied.
I show how to 
- extract and prepare this data for analysis: [NEED LINK](https://www.lemonde.fr/)
- an example of some data exploration: [NEED LINK](https://www.lemonde.fr/) to get a grasp of what it is about
-  a complete logistic regression analysis of this data, first univariate: [NEED LINK](https://www.lemonde.fr/), and then multivariate [NEED LINK](https://www.lemonde.fr/).
I have also apply several supervised Machine Learning algorithm to the data to see if the outcome can be predicted.
